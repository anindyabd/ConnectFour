Connect Four 
===============

A Connect Four game in Python that uses the turtle module. Tested with Python 2.7.7.

The AI uses the optimal Connect Four strategy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Mathematical_solution), so it will be very hard (if not impossible) to beat -- especially if you let it play first!

Gameplay: The board appears in a different window, while the user input is accepted through the terminal/ IDE.

To open the game from a Unix shell:

```python
python connectfour.py
```

May need some extra modules to run with Python 3.
